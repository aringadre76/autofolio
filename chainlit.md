# AutoFolio

Paste a GitHub repo URL or describe a project. I'll extract metadata and add it to your portfolio.

Set your **portfolio path** or **portfolio URL** in the settings (gear icon) first, or include it in your message (e.g. "portfolio at ~/my-site" or a second GitHub URL for your portfolio repo).
